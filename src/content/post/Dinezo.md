## Introduction

In the fast-paced world of design and development, honing workshop-running skills is a crucial aspect of ensuring successful project outcomes for organizations, whether conducted in-person or remotely. As a passionate UX Designer, I worked collaboratively with teams before but I always had that curiosity can we run a design sprint solo. So I decided to venture alone challenging my skills, adaptation capabilities and explore the areas of improvement as a ux designer.

## Challenge

I challenged myself to design a user-friendly chatbot for the Hotpads real estate app. As the sole UX designer in this sprint, my mission is to create a chatbot that guides users in finding their ideal homes, offering friendly recommendations and helpful information. My focus is on making the chatbot's interaction easy and intuitive, ensuring that users have a smooth and enjoyable experience while exploring real estate options.

## Constraints

- The solution should be designed as a mobile application
- All design decisions must be driven by users need and preferences ensuring that the final solution addresses real pain-points.

## Framing the problem 


The goal is to align everyone around the same understanding of the challenge and get all perspectives.

Understand and contextualize the problem by answering the four questions:

I grappled with uncertainty regarding the target audience and the specific pain points that warranted my attention. To navigate this challenge, I initiated a problem framing activity known as the 5W's exercise. 

These questions particularly helped me drafting my problem statement.

<blockquote class="text-xl italic font-SourceSerifPro-Black font-semibold text-gray-800 dark:text-white">
    <p>"The current app experience lacks real-time insights, seamless interaction, and personalized guidance, hindering user satisfaction and efficiency. A transformative solution is needed to introduce an advanced chatbot interface that empowers users with instant information, tailored recommendations, and effortless communication, revolutionizing the real estate journey and enhancing user engagement and success."</p>

 ### Pre-Research

<img src="/Hotpads/research8.jpg" class=" scale-80" alt="Alt text" title="a title" width="1200" height="200" />

Afterward, I invested several hours in conducting research. I delved into articles and gathered insights about the implementation of chatbots and the challenges associated with it.

<h2 class="font-Armio text-2xl">Day 1: Understand the Problem</h2>

On the first day, I went through a couple of activities to successfully attain and gain a deeper understanding of the user's needs, frustrations, and pain-points. I spent the entire day trying to comprehend the users.

### Interviews and Preparing How might we's

I conducted an informative interview session to understand users better. I talked with two users, and we discussed ideas and shared thoughts. They answered a few questions I had prepared to identify missing information and find ways to bridge the gaps.

After completing the interview session, I dedicated time to formulate "How Might We" statements that can guide our focus. These statements are designed to help us identify potential solutions and areas of improvement based on the insights gained from the interviews.

### Vote
I tranferred how might we statement on the next board where I spent around 20 min sort them in category vote out HMW's that aligns with our product goal, while set aside those which aren't necssary for further exploration currently.

<p class="italic text-gray-400 flex items-center text-center justify-center">Top Voted How might we's</p>

### Long term goals

When it comes to deciding the long term goals for the project, I considered various aspects like "Why are we doing this project", "Where do we wants to be in two years from now? and then I placed each long term goals on the whiteboard.

### Sprint Questions

Unlike the Long-Term Goal, which started from a place of optimism, the Sprint Questions start from a pessimistic approach. Instead of writing what we’d like to see from the future of our work, we’re going to imagine we’ve gone forward in time to when our Long-Term Goal should have materialised, and think of all the ways that our project could have been a disaster.

- What questions do we want to answer in this design sprint?
- To meet our long term goals, what has to be made true?
- Our project has failed it's long term goals, what may have caused this?

I spent 10 min writing critical assumption that are set of some questions we want to answer from this design sprint. These questions needs to be validated at some points of our design sprint. The validated questions are called Testable hypothesis which can be converted into our refined version of sprint questions.   

<!-- ### The flow
Each participant given approximately 5 min to draw their own quick flow diagram. It was rapid and intense exercise, where everyone expressed their own set of unique perspectives and ideas.

### The Map and the Target Focus

With our final map concluded with a deep discussion. The customer journey map helped us puts us in the shoes of the users, enabling us to see the entire experience from the viewpoint. By empathizing with their journey, we can identify the gaps and opportunities to enhance their interaction with product that we're making.

## Day 2 - Define and Sketch

Now that we defined our goal, sprint questions and framed the user journey map with the exact questions we want to answer, it is the time for the creativity to flow! 

### <u>Lightning Demos</u>

Up until now, we’ve been in a state of active learning, working with experts and activities to understand the problem we are facing and map the current situation that our customers or users are going through. 

<img src="/Hotpads/board.jpg" alt="Alt text" title="a title" width="1200" height="400" class=" hover:scale-150 transition-all" />

With the Lightning Demos, we start to bring all that information together into active research, looking for solutions and products that may have already done part of what we’re looking to achieve, and demoing the key learning from each of our researched subjects to the rest of the Sprint Team, so that we can all learn together.

### <u>3 Step Sketching</u>

This is the longest process of the day, during the 4 step sketching I followed the similar process drafting the solution sketches for the problem we found in the previous activities.

On this day, I did a bunch of sketching. I came up with various ideas and solutions, even though we might not realize how small some of these ideas are. It's interesting to think about how even tiny ideas could lead to big opportunities in the future.

Then I moved towards refining these ideas through Crazy'8 Exercise, where I generated 8 different possible solution to the ideas. This allowed me to take better decision.

For drafting solutions I sometimes feel like pen and paper is better than any other online tools, So I've used both ways online and offline to draft my solutions.
