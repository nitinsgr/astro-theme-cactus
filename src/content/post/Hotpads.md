### Introduction

As a student of a faciliation online class, I was practicing to become confident at running workshops solely for small projects, in person or remotely for organizations.

We had a training session where we trained to facilitate workshops with other designers, developers and different team and learn to have the orangization automatized as much as possible in order for it to be sustainable activity for us in the long run.

As a UX Designer, I was involved and contributed equally in all the activities in the design sprint.

For this project we had no budget we were fully dependent on our skills and teachings we had learned so far in our carriers.

We had some initial goals in mind:

<div class="ml-10 mt-20 ">
<h1 class="text-[28px] font-inter font-light pt-2 pb-2  text-gray-500 dark:text-white">1) Create chatbot that provides a seamless and user-friendly experience</h1>
<h1 class="text-[28px] font-inter font-normal pt-2 pb-2 text-gray-500 dark:text-white">2) Develop NLP capabilities to accurately understand and interpret user queries, considering the context of the conversationt to provide relevant responses.</h1>

<h1 class="text-[28px] font-inter font-normal text-gray-500 dark:text-white">3) Ensure the chatbot can handle multiple languages and dialects to cater to a diverse user base.</h1>
</div>

## The Process

We used the design sprint, a problem solving linear process where we work together to got a team alignment, design and prototype solutions rapidly to test it out and iterate.

For the next 5 days we are destined to use this design sprint framework where we carry out activities in a linear manner to achieve our goal.

## Sprint Planning and Briefing

We meticulously planned our sprint for the next five days, ensuring a structured and efficient approach to accomplishing our goals. Due to we had no budget and our project was not categorized as a large project we chose to use softwares and tools which were easily accessbile and easy to use by all the participants in the sprint.

- Describing Agenda for next 5 days
- Facilitator and Project Manager discussion
- Task Assignment and Role disbursement

Sprint briefing session was an exciting and crucial step in our journey, We were presented with the project's objective, which focused on enhancing the user experience, providing personalized support and streamlining interactions for hotpads users. It was inspiring to see how our work would directly impact user's interactions with the platform.

Our cross functional team, consisting of UX designer like myself, Domain experts with a deep understanding of the real-estate market came together to brainstorm and collaborate. We discussed the insights gathered from the user research, gainig valuable context about pain-points and user's need related to chatbot interactions.

Due to we had no budget and our project was not categorized as a large project we chose to softwares and tools which were easily accessbile and easy to use by all the participants in the sprint.

### Tech Setup

For most of the time, We used Mira for managing our workspace for sharing documents, performing activities etc. Google meet for our day to day meeting sessions and for note taking. I personally suggested my team to use obsidian for UX Writing and Documentation because I really liked the privacy concern about your document obsidian matters. Although few participant in the sprint had a few setbacks while using obsidian.

### Roles

Since we were all student we decided to vote ourselves on the basis of the experience, Urvarshi had a prior experience running a design sprint before took charge of our design sprint. We had our facilitator. I was responsbile for being a decider in the design sprint.

## Pre-Sprint Research

We embarked on an initial research phase to gain a deeper understanding of the problem at hand and to better support the participants in the design sprint. Recognizing the importance of a well-informed and data-driven approach, we conducted thorough research to gather relevant information, insights, and perspectives.

- Existing literatures
- Surveys conducted
- Relevant information available on internet

Later, whilst meeting facilitator asked each participants about their experience, learnings and what did they learned from the initial research. Main objective here was to keep everyone on the same page as others.

By the end of the day, we planned our design sprint for the next 5 days.

### Lightning Talk

Around 9 in the morning, the next day, we kicked off our first day of the design sprint with an engaging lightning talk centered around the topic we had carefully planned during the design sprint planning phase. The purpose of the lightning talk was to provide the team with valuable insights, inspiration, and a shared understanding of the topic at hand.
