## Introduction

During an online facilitation class, I honed my workshop-running skills to confidently handle small projects for organizations, whether in person or remotely.
In a training session, we practiced facilitating workshops alongside designers, developers, and diverse teams. Our aim was to streamline organizational processes and automation to ensure sustainable practices in the long term.

### My role
As a UX Designer, I actively participated and made equal contributions throughout the design sprint activities.

With no budget for this project, we relied entirely on the skills and knowledge we had acquired in our careers.

Throughout the process, we had some specific initial goals in mind:

<div class="ml-10 mt-20 ">
<h3 class="text-[20px] pt-2 pb-2  text-gray-500 dark:text-white">1) Create chatbot that provides a seamless and user-friendly experience</h3>
<h2 class="text-[20px] pt-2 pb-2 text-gray-500 dark:text-white">2) Develop NLP capabilities to accurately understand and interpret user queries, considering the context of the conversationt to provide relevant responses.</h2>

<h2 class="text-[20px] text-gray-500 dark:text-white">3) Ensure the chatbot can handle multiple languages and dialects to cater to a diverse user base.</h2>

## Sprint Planning and Briefing

Sprint briefing session was an exciting and crucial step in our journey, We were presented with the project's objective, which focused on enhancing the user experience, providing personalized support and streamlining interactions for hotpads users.

During the sprint planning we made several documents stating our initial challenges, objectives and agenda planning for the next 5 days.

  />
</div>


Due to we had no budget and our project was not categorized as a large project we chose to softwares and tools which were easily accessbile and easy to use by all the participants in the sprint.


## Pre-Sprint Research

Day before sprint team had a pre-sprint discussion where we discussed research that has been done so far with the topic. Through research we gained the deeper understanding on the topic.

### Team Discussion

Around 9 in the morning, the next day, we kicked off our first day of the design sprint with an engaging lightning talk centered around the topic we had carefully planned during the design sprint planning phase. The purpose of the lightning talk was to provide the team with valuable insights, inspiration, and a shared understanding of the topic at hand.



### Subject Matter Interview & HMW Questions

Before our sprint session, to have a better understanding about their online behavior and interaction pattern.The UX team conducted interviews with subject matter expert and users who have decent knowledge about the subject.

All team members watched the recorded expert interview and shared research dcoument about the user's current behavior and how do they interact with the application on their daily basis. Based on the research data we wrote our "How might We" questions on Invision Freehand whiteboard.

### Vote
After completing the process of drafting the How Might We (HMW) statements, we immediately proceeded to a voting session, which lasted for 10 minutes. During this engaging session, our team aimed to identify and eliminate any repetitive HMW statements while prioritizing the most impactful ones for our project.

<h3 class="font-bold text-xl">Top 3 How might we's</h3>

- #### How might we personalize the chatbot's recommendation based on the each user's unique preferences and requirements, aligning with the personalization and engagement focus are. This will enhance user satifaction and increase the likelihood of finding suitable properties.(Alignment with goals and objective)

### Long term goals and Sprint Questions

For the sprint long term goals, we had a conversation about: "why are we doing this project", where do we want to be two years from now? then on the digital cards we shared statements started with "In two years time"... phrases to capture the long term vision of our solution.

In the next step, we ideated about what could stop us from getting to the long term goal and what should we need overcome to meet our long term goal. Our statement begin with the "Can we" phrase.

## Map 

With all the insights and findings on a single place this helped us creating a user map. User journey map shows us the path user would take to complete a process and reaching their goal.

We placed our findings and insights on the map to help us guide through and achieve a target focus where we should be working on during the project.
