### Introduction

In the fast-paced world of design and development, honing workshop-running skills is a crucial aspect of ensuring successful project outcomes for organizations, whether conducted in-person or remotely. As a passionate UX Designer, I recently had the opportunity to participate in an online facilitation class that significantly bolstered my ability to handle small projects effectively.

The core objective of the training session was to streamline organizational processes and embrace automation, aiming to establish sustainable practices in the long run. Working in collaboration with fellow designers, developers, and diverse teams, we embarked on an exciting journey to explore innovative solutions.

## Role

Throughout the design sprint activities, I actively engaged as a UX Designer and made equal contributions to the team's progress. My background in user experience allowed me to bring a unique perspective to the table, ensuring that the workshops were not only efficient but also user-centered.

The absence of a budget for this particular project encouraged us to tap into the vast reservoir of skills and knowledge we had acquired over the course of our careers. Resourcefulness became our greatest asset, pushing us to think creatively and adapt to the challenges that arose.

We have been presented with a challenging problem: to create an intelligent conversational chatbot for a real-estate application that elevates user engagement, enhances customer support, and streamlines the property search process.

 Our ultimate goal is to significantly improve user satisfaction, increase customer retention, and establish the real-estate application as a frontrunner in the industry.

### Pre-sprint Planning

Sprint briefing session was an exciting and crucial step in our journey, We were presented with the project's objective, which focused on enhancing the user experience, providing personalized support and streamlining interactions for hotpads users.

During the sprint planning we made several documents stating our initial challenges, objectives and agenda planning for the next 5 days.

Due to we had no budget and our project was not categorized as a large project we chose to softwares and tools which were easily accessbile and easy to use by all the participants in the sprint.


### Pre-Sprint Research

Day before sprint team had a pre-sprint discussion where we discussed research that has been done so far with the topic. Through research we gained the deeper understanding on the topic.

We ended our kickoff day session with a sense of accomplishment, having gathered relevant information, valuable insights, and a profound understanding of the topic itself. Each participant was entitled to contribute their unique perspectives, expertise, and enthusiasm, making the session truly collaborative and enriching.

We had many activities in this session, we held a meeting where we dicsussed more about the problem and framing the actual problem.


### Subject Matter Interview & HMW Questions

Before our sprint session, to have a better understanding about their online behavior and interaction pattern.The UX team conducted interviews with subject matter expert and users who have decent knowledge about the subject.During the interview session, we delved into the topic of chatbot integration and explored the potential challenges that may arise during the process.

All team members watched the recorded expert interview and shared research dcoument about the user's current behavior and how do they interact with the application on their daily basis. Based on the research data we wrote our "How might We" questions on Invision Freehand whiteboard.

### Vote
After completing the process of drafting the How Might We (HMW) statements, we immediately proceeded to a voting session, which lasted for 10 minutes. During this engaging session, our team aimed to identify and eliminate any repetitive HMW statements while prioritizing the most impactful ones for our project.

### Long term goals and Sprint Questions

For the sprint long term goals, we had a conversation about: "why are we doing this project", where do we want to be two years from now? then on the digital cards we shared statements started with "In two years time"... phrases to capture the long term vision of our solution.

In the next step, we ideated about what could stop us from getting to the long term goal and what should we need overcome to meet our long term goal. Our statement begin with the "Can we" phrase.

## Map 

With all the insights and findings on a single place this helped us creating a user map. User journey map shows us the path user would take to complete a process and reaching their goal.

We have successfully crafted a comprehensive user journey map that outlines the path a user would undertake to achieve their task, highlighting the actions they take to accomplish it

This detailed map proved to be an invaluable tool in guiding us towards setting a clear target focus for our sprint. For this sprint we chose to focus on only one actor "User" throughout the sprint we aimed to solve problems identified for the users which eventually became our target focus.
